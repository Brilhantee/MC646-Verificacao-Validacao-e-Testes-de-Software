&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Layout algorithm interface.
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The layout algorithm role is to compute the best possible positions of nodes
&nbsp; * in a given space (2D or 3D) and eventually break points for edges if
&nbsp; * supported using either aesthetic constraints, hierarchical constraints or
&nbsp; * grouping constraints. As there are many such algorithms with distinct
&nbsp; * qualities and uses, this interface defines what is awaited from a general
&nbsp; * layout algorithm.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This algorithm is a {@link Pipe} that receives notifications on the graph
&nbsp; * eventually maintain an internal representation of it (or for some of them
&nbsp; * work directly on the graph), and in return send graph events to give each
&nbsp; * node a position via &quot;xyz&quot; attributes. Some algorithms may also export more
&nbsp; * information for nodes and edges. For example some algorithms are also able to
&nbsp; * work on the shape of an edge or the shape of a node.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The layout algorithm described by this interface may be iterative. Some
&nbsp; * algorithm will compute directly their final representation of the graph in
&nbsp; * one pass. However most algorithms will probably work step by step until a
&nbsp; * global quality function is satisfied. This is the best way to handle evolving
&nbsp; * graphs.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This behavior has been chosen because this algorithm is often run aside the
&nbsp; * main thread that works on the graph. We want a thread to be able to compute a
&nbsp; * new layout on its side, without disturbing the main algorithm run on the
&nbsp; * graph. See the {@link org.graphstream.ui.layout.LayoutRunner} for an helper
&nbsp; * class allowing to create such a thread.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * To be notified of the layout changes dynamically, you must register as a sink
&nbsp; * of the layout.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The graph viewers in the UI package often use a layout algorithm to present
&nbsp; * graphs on screen.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
