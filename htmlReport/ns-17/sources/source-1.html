&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Allows to run a layout in a distinct thread.
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * A layout runner will run in its own thread and periodically activate a layout
&nbsp; * algorithm on a graph event stream (you do not need a graph). This
&nbsp; * implementation is mainly used by the graph viewer but could be used by any
&nbsp; * program that needs a layout algorithm that run continuously on a dynamic
&nbsp; * graph (adapting the layout as the graph changes).
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The layout algorithms in GraphStream are iterative versions that can be
&nbsp; * called repeatedly to take graph dynamics into account and may produce a
&nbsp; * result only after several invocations. This is why the layout runner invokes
&nbsp; * the layout on a regular basis. The runner is temporized, it will not run in a
&nbsp; * loop as fast as possible, instead it will wait a little between each layout
&nbsp; * invocation. When the last layout invocation indicated the layout was good, it
&nbsp; * will wait longer that when the last invocation indicated the layout was not
&nbsp; * good (stabilized). These two times can be configured using
&nbsp; * {@link #setNaps(long, long)}.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Once you finished using the runner, you must call {@link #release()} to break
&nbsp; * the link with the event source and stop the thread. The runner cannot be used
&nbsp; * after.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
