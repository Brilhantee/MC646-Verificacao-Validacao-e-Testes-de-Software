&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Represent the history of energy values for a force-based layout algorithm.
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The main intended usage is with the various force layout algorithms that use
&nbsp; * a an &quot;energy&quot; minimization process to compute a layout. This class allows to
&nbsp; * store the energy at a current step of layout computation and to remember a
&nbsp; * history of such steps.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * At a current step of layout computation, one can accumulate energy in the
&nbsp; * current cell of the energies buffer using {@link #accumulateEnergy(double)}.
&nbsp; * When the step finishes, one calls {@link #storeEnergy()} to store this
&nbsp; * accumulated energy in a cell of the memory, push a new cell on the memory and
&nbsp; * therefore start a new step.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * At any time you can get the last energy value computed with
&nbsp; * {@link #getEnergy()}. Be careful this is not the energy currently accumulated
&nbsp; * but the value of the last energy stored with {@link #storeEnergy()}. You can
&nbsp; * also get at any time the average energy in the memory with
&nbsp; * {@link #getAverageEnergy()}, as well as an estimate of the stabilization (how
&nbsp; * much the energies are varying) using {@link #getStabilization()}.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
