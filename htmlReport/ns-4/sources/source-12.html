&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Proxy pipe.
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * A proxy is a kind of event buffer that allows to pass some kind of barrier.
&nbsp; * The barrier can be a thread or a network for example. A proxy completely
&nbsp; * decouple the source from the sink. The proxy buffers the source events and
&nbsp; * when possible it sends them to the listeners at the sink. In other words, a
&nbsp; * proxy is indirect, non synchronized and non blocking.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The usual source/sink mechanism is synchronized, direct and blocking : when
&nbsp; * the event occurs, all listeners are called, and we have to wait they finish
&nbsp; * to process these events to continue and send new events.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * With proxies, there is a buffer often compared to a mail box. Each event
&nbsp; * produced as source is buffered and when the sink is free to receive these
&nbsp; * events it can check the mail box and empty it, thus receiving the pending
&nbsp; * events. This way of doing is completely non synchronized and non blocking
&nbsp; * (due to the mail box).
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This way of doing allows for example to pass a thread frontier with a minimum
&nbsp; * of synchronization : only the mail box has to be synchronized. And the source
&nbsp; * and sink can most of the time run in parallel. Without such a proxy, we would
&nbsp; * have to synchronize the whole graph, and threads would consume their time
&nbsp; * waiting one another since most of the work in GraphStream is centered on
&nbsp; * graphs.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * For networks, this is the same thing : events are buffered before sending
&nbsp; * them to the network. When the other end is ready it can check these events in
&nbsp; * one operation.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * However proxies have a limitation : they force the receiving end to check for
&nbsp; * events regularly. This can be compared to &quot;pumping&quot; since the whole
&nbsp; * GraphStream metaphor is a set of sources, pipes and sinks. Here instead of
&nbsp; * flowing freely, the event stream must be pumped manually to receive it. This
&nbsp; * is however most of the time not a problem since most work on graphs in
&nbsp; * GraphStream is dynamic and runs iteratively.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
