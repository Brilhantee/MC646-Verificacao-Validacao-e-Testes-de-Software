&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Base implementation for graph output to files.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This class provides base services to write graphs into files using a specific
&nbsp; * file format. It allows to create an output stream. By default a print stream
&nbsp; * for easy text output, but binary files are possible.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * It handles completely the {@link #writeAll(Graph, OutputStream)},
&nbsp; * {@link #writeAll(Graph, String)}, {@link #begin(OutputStream)},
&nbsp; * {@link #begin(String)}, {@link #flush()} and {@link #end()} methods. You
&nbsp; * should not have to modify or override these.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * In order to implement an output you have to:
&nbsp; * &lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Eventually override {@link #createWriter(OutputStream)} or
&nbsp; * {@link #createWriter(String)} to replace the default instance of PrintStream
&nbsp; * created for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Implement the {@link #outputHeader()} method. This method is called at
&nbsp; * start, before any graph event is sent to output. Use it to output the header
&nbsp; * of your file.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Implement the {@link #outputEndOfFile()} method. This method is called at
&nbsp; * the end of the output, just before closing the output stream. Use it to
&nbsp; * output any terminating syntax for the file format you implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;Implement all the methods of {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}. All
&nbsp; * these methods will be called for each graph event and must export these
&nbsp; * events to the file you are writing. You should use the {@link #output} field
&nbsp; * to write to the file. This field has type {@link java.io.OutputStream} but by
&nbsp; * default is of type {@link java.io.PrintStream}, as most of the file format
&nbsp; * will be textual.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ul&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
