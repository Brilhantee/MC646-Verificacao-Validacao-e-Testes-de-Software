&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Source of graph events coming from a file.
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The file input interface is an input with specific methods that deals with
&nbsp; * files. File inputs are designed to handle graphs stored under the form of a
&nbsp; * textual or binary file either under the form of a file name or a Java input
&nbsp; * stream. If the file comes from an URL, convert the URL to an input stream.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The file package is designed under the idea that it provides graph inputs
&nbsp; * from files that store the graph under a given file format and encoding. The
&nbsp; * package provides decoders for all these formats.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Do not confuse the file package with the net package that can also read from
&nbsp; * URLs, but build graph not from encoded description of a graph, but from web
&nbsp; * services like Flickr or Amazon, or simply networks of web pages tied by web
&nbsp; * links. The graph construction task is entirely different.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Although not all graph format handle dynamic graphs, all file inputs must
&nbsp; * provide both the readAll() and begin()/nextEvents()/end() methods. The later
&nbsp; * must read one graph modification at a time.
