&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Definition of some compound value that can be used as attribute and can be
&nbsp; * transformed to a hash map.
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The purpose of this class is to allow to specify how some values are stored
&nbsp; * in the graph and can be exported to files (or others) when the graph is
&nbsp; * output. Most graph writers can only handle basic types for attributes (when
&nbsp; * they are able to store attributes in files). This interface may allow to
&nbsp; * store more complex attributes, made of several elements. The DGS writer is
&nbsp; * able to understand these kinds of attributes and store them in files.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The compound attribute is made of fields. Each fields has a name and a value.
&nbsp; * For these fields to be exported successfully, they must be transformable to a
&nbsp; * hash map where each element is indexed by its name (a String).
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; * 
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * For the values to be exported successfully, they must either be basic types,
&nbsp; * or be themselves instances of CompountAttribute.
&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
